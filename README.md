# Effective-diagnosis-of-Breast-Cancer-using-KNN-Algorithm
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in human beings. Breast cancer is considered to be 2nd most exposed cancer in the world and is now very commonly seen disease in women. The women of ages 45-59 has the highest number of chances to be affected by Breast cancer. Early prediction and diagnosis of Breast cancer can prevent its spread and can also aid in effective treatment or medication. Predicting Breast cancer can be a very arduous task as the data can be highly Non-linear and may require high level computation modelling. However, many machine learning algorithms like KNN, K-Means, Decision Trees, Neural Networks etc. have proved to be effective in predicting Breast cancer. This study shows the using of K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and K-Means algorithm to predict whether a person is having Breast cancer or not using a machine learning model trained with different features. Thus, we inferred that we can predict the Breast Cancer with reasonable accuracy. 

# Problem Formulation
The problem formulation consists of just one sentence and should make it clear to everyone what research problem you aim to address and to whom and where it is relevant. In other words, the problem formulation is the heart (or core) of your thesis to which you should always return if you lose track during your further research and writing process.
In this fast growing and busy world, people often forget to take care of their heath and even tends to neglect sudden major/minor changes in the body. Proposing such a behavior can lead to serious health issues in future. Hence, to avoid such situations we take initiative to diagnose one of the most recurrent type of cancer i.e. Breast Cancer. The initiative is to ease the burden and money of the people is our soul requirement. This will eventually help them to identify whether they are victim to Breast cancer and will help in early diagnosis and treatment for the same. 

# Motivation
The overwhelming increase in the number of people affected by Breast cancer around the globe and to explore the significant domain of “Machine Learning” has motivated us to develop this project. In addition, to help women for early diagnosis of Breast cancer using machine learning algorithms made us think to develop this project and work towards the solution of this problem. So, we wish to design a system which will be easily available to them, using which people can diagnose themselves and get treatment on time.

# Proposed Solution
The solution infers with the use of K-Means and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), the two machine learning algorithms. The primary requirement of the system is the Breast cancer dataset which is collected from Wisconsin data repository. The dataset contains multiple features of cells which will be used to predict cancer cells in two classes which are Benign and Malignant. Next, the dataset is pre-processed in order to eliminate any inaccurate or outlier records and replace it with the appropriate variable. Further the data is trained and tested which helps us to evaluate the model’s performance such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
